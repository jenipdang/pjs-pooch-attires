						<strong>We love dogs</strong> - this is the prime reason why PJ's
						Pooch Attires was created. In fact, we love them so much that we
						want them to have their own clothing line! Here at PJ's Pooch
						Attires, we understand that your pet is a part of the family because
						we’re pet parents too. It is our pleasure to be able to share our
						love of dogs with you. PJ's Pooch Attires isn't just a pet store. We
						are pet people, pet lovers, and pet parents. We are just like you.
						When you shop with us, you can feel confident knowing that we
						wouldn’t sell anything that we wouldn’t give to our own pets.
