## Reflection

This was almost a 4 week long project built during my second phase at Flatiron School. Project goals included 
- buidling a React single page application from scratch
- apply knowledge of components, props and state management
- incorporate client-side routing
- use data from an API 
- add styling by writing CSS from scratch, using styled-components and also incorporate UI framework

My original plan was to build an application that displays products from the API that I built with some filter and search features, but as I spend more time familiarizing myself with different documentations, I started to be creative and not limit myself from what I can use and apply.
